				certain information relevant to Your Order including, without limitation, Your name, Your
				email, Your phone number, Your credit card number, the expiration date of Your credit card,

				card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Order; and that (ii) the
				information You supply to us is true, correct and complete.

			<br />
			<p>
				By submitting such information, You grant us the right to provide the information to payment
				processing third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Your Order.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2 class="text-2xl" id="order-cancellation">Order Cancellation</h2>
			<p>
				We reserve the right to refuse or cancel Your Order at any time for certain reasons
				including but not limited to:
			</p>
			<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
				<li>Goods availability</li>
				<li>Errors in the description or prices for Goods</li>
				<li>Errors in Your Order</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				We reserve the right to refuse or cancel Your Order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal
				transaction is suspected.

				Our Returns Policy forms a part of these Terms and Conditions. Please read our Returns
				Policy to learn more about your right to cancel Your Order.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Your right to cancel an Order only applies to Goods that are returned in the same condition
				as You received them. You should also include all of the products instructions, documents
				and wrappings. Goods that are damaged or not in the same condition as You received them or
				which are worn simply beyond opening the original packaging will not be refunded. You should
				therefore take reasonable care of the purchased Goods while they are in Your possession.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				We will reimburse You no later than 14 days from the day on which We receive the returned
				Goods. We will use the same means of payment as You used for the Order, and You will not
				incur any fees for such reimbursement.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				You will not have any right to cancel an Order for the supply of any of the following Goods:

					The supply of Goods which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene
					reasons and were unsealed after delivery.

					mixed with other items.
				</li>
				<li>
					The supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the
					performance has begun with Your prior express consent and You have acknowledged Your loss
					of cancellation right.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<h2 class="text-2xl" id="availability">Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</h2>

			<p>

			<p>
				The Company reserves the right to revise its prices at any time prior to accepting an Order.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				The prices quoted may be revised by the Company subsequent to accepting an Order in the
				event of any occurrence affecting delivery caused by government action, variation in customs
				duties, increased shipping charges, higher foreign exchange costs and any other matter
				beyond the control of the Company. In that event, You will have the right to cancel Your
				Order.
			</p>
			<br />

				cards or online payment methods (PayPal, for example).
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Payment cards (credit cards or debit cards) are subject to validation checks and
				authorization by Your card issuer. If we do not receive the required authorization, We will
				not be liable for any delay or non-delivery of Your Order.

				possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for
				incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not
				apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent
